2.3 Inferring the Types of Columns in Your Data
===========================================

Before you do anything else with a new data set, you should try to find out what each column in your current table represents. Some people like to call this information a data dictionary, by which they mean that you might be handed a short verbal descrip-tion of every column in the data set. For example, imagine that you had the unlabeled data set in Table 2-2 given to you.

*Table 2-2. Unlabeled data*<br>

Without any identifying information, it¡¯s really hard to know what to make of these numbers. Indeed, as a starting point you should figure out the type of each column: is the first column really a string, even though it looks like it contains only 0s and 1s? In the UFO example in the first chapter, we immediately labeled all of the columns of the data set we were given. When we¡¯re given a data set without labels, we can use some of the type determination functions built into R. Three of the most important of these functions are shown in Table 2-3.

*Table 2-3. Type determination in R*<br>
![Table 2-3](https://raw.github.com/caoxudong/ml_hackers/master/images/table2-3.png "Table 2-3. Type determination in R")

Having basic type information about each column can be very important as we move forward because a single R function will often do different things depending on the type of its inputs. Those 0s and 1s stored as characters in our current data set need to be translated into numbers before we can use some of the built-in functions in R, but they actually need to be converted into factors if we¡¯re going to use some other built-in functions. In part, this tendency to move back and forth between types comes from a general  tradition  in  machine  learning  for  dealing  with  categorical  distinctions. Many variables that really work like labels or categories are encoded mathematically as 0 and 1. You can think of these numbers as if they were Boolean values: 0 might indicate that an email is not spam, a 1 might indicate that the email is spam. This specific use of 0s and 1s to describe qualitative properties of an object is often called dummy coding in machine learning and statistics. The dummy coding system should be dis-tinguished from R¡¯s factors, which express qualitative properties using explicit labels.

>Factors in R can be thought of as labels, but the labels are actually en-coded numerically in the background: when the programmer accesses the label, the numeric values are translated into the character labels specified in an indexed array of character strings. Because R uses a nu-meric coding in the background, naive attempts to convert the labels for an R factor into numbers will produce strange results because you¡¯ll be given the actual encoding scheme¡¯s numbers rather than the numbers associated with the labels for the factor.

Tables 2-4 through 2-6 show the same data, but the data has been described with three different encoding schemes.

*Table 2-4. Factor coding*<br>
![Table 2-4](https://raw.github.com/caoxudong/ml_hackers/master/images/table2-4.png "Table 2-4. Factor coding")

*Table 2-5. Dummy coding*<br>
![Table 2-4](https://raw.github.com/caoxudong/ml_hackers/master/images/table2-5.png "Table 2-5. Dummy coding")

*Table 2-6. Physicists coding*<br>
![Table 2-6](https://raw.github.com/caoxudong/ml_hackers/master/images/table2-6.png "Table 2-6. Physicists coding")

In Table 2-4, IsSpam is meant to be treated directly as a factor in R, which is one way to express qualitative distinctions. In practice, it might be loaded as a factor or as a string, depending on the data loading function you use (see the stringsAsFactors parameter that was described in Chapter 1 for details). With every new data set, you¡¯ll need to figure out whether the values are being loaded properly as factors or as strings after you¡¯ve decided how you would like each column to be treated by R.

>If you are unsure, it is often better to begin by loading things as strings. You can always convert a string column to a factor column later.

In Table 2-5, IsSpam is still a qualitative concept, but it¡¯s being encoded using numeric values that represent a Boolean distinction: 1 means IsSpam is true, whereas 0 means IsSpam is false. This style of numeric coding is actually required by some machine learning algorithms. For example, glm, the default function in R for using logistic re- gression and a classification algorithm we¡¯ll describe in the next chapter, assumes that your variables are dummy coded.

Finally, in Table 2-6, we show another type of numeric encoding for the same qualitative concept. In this encoding system, people use +1 and -1 instead of 1 and 0. This style of encoding qualitative distinctions is very popular with physicists, so you will eventually see it as you read more about machine learning. In this book, though, we completely avoid using this style of notation because we think it¡¯s a needless source of confusion to move back and forth between different ways of expressing the same distinctions.
